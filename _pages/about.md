I am a software engineer from Portugal with a strong passion about pretty much everything.

Currently living in Berlin I am working as a Frontend Developer in [Savedo](https://www.savedo.de), a FinTech startup which aims to become the Nr. 1 online platform for financial investments in Europe.

I am also engaged in a volunteer initiative to assist refugees in becoming software developers - [codedoor.org](http://www.codedoor.org).

Among my top interests I love everything which relates to web, electronic music, cooking, politics, world culture and I am always eager to learn new stuff.
